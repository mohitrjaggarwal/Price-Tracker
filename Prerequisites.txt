-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is for explaining what the application needs in order to work properly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

< 1 > WEB - SCRAPING

The  script uses requests and BeautifulSoup for web-scraping.
Since Amazon uses different CSS IDs and classes for the products that are in a sale
or offer, the scipt can only scrape off data from regular products which are not in
any kind of sale/offer or anything like that. Since its fairly easy to implement the code
that would scrape products that are under sale/offer as well (just a different ID or
class in the HTML code).


< 2 > Google Spreadsheets

Google spreadsheets is used as an database for this application.
3 Google Spreadsheets will be needed, that would be on your G-Drive in order for this to work.
The format of the spreadsheets should be as follows:

 (I) Name : URLs
     2 Columns required:
     
     ITEM   |   URL    |
     ------------------------------
	    | 	       |	
     ------------------------------
     	    | 	       |
     ------------------------------
            |	       |


 (II) Name : Amazon
    1 Column required:
     
     DAY/PRODUCTS |	       |
     -------------------------------------
	          | 	       |	
     -------------------------------------
     	          | 	       |
     -------------------------------------
                  |	       |
    	
 (III) Name : Flipkart
       1 Column required:
       
       DAY/PRODUCTS |	       |
       -------------------------------------
	            | 	       |	
       -------------------------------------
       	            | 	       |
       -------------------------------------
                    |	       |

< 3 > APIs

This application uses 3 APIs :
   (i) Google Sheets API
  (ii) Google Drive API
 (iii) Twilio API

-In order for the application to work, the user must create an account on Google developers console
 After making an account, the user must enable Google Sheets API & Google Drive API.
 Once done, user must create credentials for the Google Sheets API, and download the json file that
 has the user's credentials in it. Watch this video in order to clearly understand this procedure :
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnPlKLEGR7E&t=603s
 After downloading the json file that has your credentials in it, rename it to 'credentials.json' and place
 it in the root of the directory.
 You also need to share your client_email (in credential.json) to the all 3 of the G-spreadsheets that you created 
 earlier, as shown in the video. This completes the G-Sheets API

-Now onto Twilio API for sending WhatsApp message purposes. Go to twilio's website and sign up for a free account
 Verify your phone whatsapp phone number through the process shown on the website. Store you credentials safely somewhere
 that you get for your Twilio API. You will need to send an 'ok' text to twilio API on your mobile everyday, for which a remonder is 
 already set in the code. 


 < 4 > USER - CONTROL

 The user can input the product (only from amazon or flipkart) by running the source_input.py script locally or from the cloud.
 The details are stored in the Google spreadsheet. And That's it.



----------SET UP COMPLETE----------------
The user can now sit back & relax and wait for the price of any particular product to drop, which if it does, the user shall recieve a message on 
WhatsApp regarding the same.
